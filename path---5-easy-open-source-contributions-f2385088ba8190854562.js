It lets employers know you are passionate about what you do, and it is a great way to give back to the community. But getting started can be difficult unless you know how to implement a library, contributing to open source can be a struggle. I hope to help lessen the barrier to open source with this blog post. </p>\n<p>Starting your own projects is great, but if no one else is caring about them... then they aren\'t really considered as contributing to open source. And getting people interested may be a lot of work. This guide is aimed at contributing to other projects - particularly projects that have less traction than the popular projects such as Vue, Node etcetera that are often backed by companies. </p>\n<h2>Syntax updates</h2>\n<p>Many languages such as Javascript undergo syntax amendments and thus open source projects may result in using of outdated syntax, Some project maintainers welcome syntax updates, others might not, but it does not hurt to make a pull request and find out. </p>\n<h2>Grammar + Typo fixes contributions</h2>\n<p>The documentation and (source code) comments of projects may be written by people not fluent in the (natural) language of the project, thus you can improve upon what people are trying to say.\n</p>\n<h2>Marketing / Branding</h2>\n<p>Make the repository more attractive by improving documentation, perhaps it lacks formatting, images or colour - if you are an artsy person, this is your chance to shine. </p>\n<h2>Getting started guides + Examples</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the documentation could provide a much more concise getting started guide, or perhaps the project lacks examples, you can make these tutorials to help improve the adoption of such projects.\n</p>\n<h2>Community</h2>\n<p>Help do code reviews for new pull requests, help people contribute to the project, ensure people follow the contribution guidelines (if tests are involved make sure they are being passed), ensure the project does not stray from its original purpose and philosophy. This one requires a bit more commitment than the others. </p>\n<h2>Code Refactoring (And Optimizations)</h2>\n<p>Perhaps someone has submitted a new feature or bug fix, but could improve their code quality and has not got the time or knowledge to do it, then you can </p>\n<h2>Bonus</h2>\n<p>User-friendliness = good, thus the more you can improve the user-friendliness of a project, the more good you can do. You know what is a great usability feature... Beautifully crafted 404 pages - this blog post was mostly aimed at projects that don\'t actually have a user-interface but if it does and you are good at user-interfaces, then consider yourself lucky, because some people are not. Even the user-interfaces for command-line interfaces can be improved by making output such as error log more concise, better formatted and perhaps even have a bit of colour and user-feedback too, like progress bars made out of the text - those are cool, what is also cool is the SailsJS console output.  Also, it helps to give suggestions on how to improve projects and issues you have encountered while using them. </p>\n<p>Often times the contributions that people are not willing to do are the best contributions. If you are reading this in October, I hope you are ready to complete Hacktoberfest and obtain that prize (it is usually a t-shirt). </p>',frontmatter:{path:"/5-easy-open-source-contributions",title:"5 Easy Open Source Contributions"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
