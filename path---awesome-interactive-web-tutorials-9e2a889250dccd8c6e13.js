And be aware that yes, they may contain bugs. </p>\n<p>The main great thing about these is they provide you with a ready-to-go environment. Usually, as a developer, you can spend a lot of time installing stuff. realizing that things didn\'t install correctly and thus - re-installing the same thing... So much of my time has been wasted by installation Wizards, to the point where I think... I could have finished learning this tool by now, but my computer refuses to play nice with it. </p>\n<h1>Codecademy</h1>\n<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com">https://www.codecademy.com</a>\nI am sort of cheating by putting this here, but it was my first dose of being able to learn something truly interactively - Codecademy is a website that allows you to learn various coding languages and tooling through their interactive website. This is what I used to start coding but I have not used it in a while. </p>\n<h1>Play-With-Docker Classroom</h1>\n<p><a href="https://training.play-with-docker.com">https://training.play-with-docker.com</a>\n<a href="https://training.play-with-kubernetes.com">https://training.play-with-kubernetes.com</a> <a href="https://training.play-with-kubernetes.com">https://training.play-with-kubernetes.com</a>\nThis one is for learning the containerization tool Docker. There is also one for Kubernates, but I am yet to explore Kubernates. </p>\n<h1>Flexbox Froggy</h1>\n<p><a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com">https://flexboxfroggy.com</a>\nThis is a (fun, perhaps a bit childish) game for learning the CSS layout and display model: Flex/Flexbox. </p>\n<h1>Flexbox Defense</h1>\n<p><a href="http://www.flexboxdefense.com">http://www.flexboxdefense.com</a>\nPretty much the same concept as Flexbox Froggy. But from a tower-defense perspective... in case aligning frogs isn\'t your thing. </p>\n<h1>Grid Garden</h1>\n<p><a href="http://cssgridgarden.com">http://cssgridgarden.com</a>\nSimilar concept as Flexbox Froggy but for CSS Grid. </p>\n<h1>Trygit</h1>\n<no-longer available but included for historical reasons in the hope that it returns>\nThis one is for learning the version control system Git. In an easy and digestible manner. \n<p>These are all fun, engaging and convenient ways to practice tooling that people may otherwise procrastinate on learning. </p>',frontmatter:{path:"/awesome-interactive-web-tutorials",title:"Awesome Interactive Web Tutorials"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
